SitecoreSuperchargers.Historian
===============================

A Supercharger for Sitecore CMS that enables easy reuse of the history engine for all sorts of integration scenarios.

To build, you will need to copy Sitecore.Kernel.dll and Sitecore.Logging.dll into the sc.lib folder.
TDS is used for this solution in order to facilitate the build & deploy, but not a requirement.
